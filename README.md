[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server to help plan routes using **[OpenRouteService.org](https://openrouteservice.org)**, for activities such as hiking or mountain biking.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **DISCLAIMER:** The routes generated by this service are provided for informational purposes only and are **not guaranteed to be safe, legal, or suitable** for your intended use. Generated routes may:
>
> - Cross private property or restricted areas
> - Include paths that are closed, dangerous, or poorly maintained
> - Not reflect current trail conditions, weather hazards, or seasonal closures
> - Contain errors in elevation, distance, or difficulty estimates
>
> **Always verify routes independently** using official maps, local authorities, and current conditions before attempting any journey. Users assume all risks and responsibilities for their safety and compliance with local laws and regulations.

> [!TIP]
>
> Copy the whole GPX file returned as part of the tool call results, and use a service such as [gpx.studio](https://gpx.studio) to load the generated GPX file on a map.

## üõ†Ô∏è Available tools

- **üìç Find possible coordinates for a location**
  - Arguments:
    - `location` (string): location to get coordinates for
  - Returns: list of 10 coordinates with available description to enable the agent figure out the right one
- **üó∫Ô∏è Create a route** from a starting location to a destination, optionally with waypoints
  - Arguments:
    - `route_type` (string): Type of route, e.g. "driving-car", "cycling-mountain", "cycling-regular", "foot-hiking"
    - `from_coordinates` (list[float]): Starting location as [longitude, latitude]
    - `from_coordinates` (list[float]): Destination location as [longitude, latitude]
    - `waypoints` (list[list[float]]): optional list of waypoints coordinates as [[lon, lat], ...]
  - Returns:
    - the route as a GPX string
    - a resource file containing the **route GPX** (e.g. `route://foot-hiking-98.gpx`)
    - a resource file containing a **PNG image** visualization of the route (e.g. `route://foot-hiking-98.png`)
    - a resource file containing a **HTML** interactive visualization of the route (e.g. `route://foot-hiking-98.html`) that can be directly opened with your browser
- **üìå Search for Points of Interest** (POIs) in an area
  - Arguments:
    - `bounding_box_coordinates` (list[list[float]]): coordinates defining a bounding box as [[min_lon, min_lat], [max_lon, max_lat]]
    - `filters_name` (list[string]): optional list of names to filter POIs, e.g. ["Gas station", "Restaurant"]
  - Returns: found POIs information
- **üîé Search for known routes** close to a given start and end coordinates, this enables to suggest waypoints to go through known trails when creating a route (only working in Switzerland for now).
  - Arguments:
    - `route_type` (string): Type of route, e.g. "driving-car", "cycling-mountain", "cycling-regular", "foot-hiking"
    - `from_coordinates` (list[float]): Starting location as [longitude, latitude]
    - `from_coordinates` (list[float]): Destination location as [longitude, latitude]
  - Returns: known trails trace and description when available to help the agent build a nice route

## üóÉÔ∏è Available Resources

- **üöè Route file**
  - URL pattern: `route://{filename}`
  - Type: GPX file (`.gpx`)
  - Description: Returns a previously generated GPX route by filename.
  - Produced by: `create_route_from_to` tool


## üîå Connect client to MCP server

Follow the instructions of your client, and use the `/mcp` URL of your deployed server (e.g. http://localhost:8888/mcp)

For example, for [GitHub Copilot in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview), to add a new MCP server through the VSCode UI:

- [x] Open side panel chat (`ctrl+shift+i` or `cmd+shift+i`), and make sure the mode is set to `Agent` in the bottom right
- [x] Open command palette (`ctrl+shift+p` or `cmd+shift+p`), and search for `MCP: Open User Configuration`, this will open a `mcp.json` file

### ‚å®Ô∏è Use stdio transport

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Login with GitHub to [openrouteservice.org](https://openrouteservice.org/) and get an API key that you can provide through the `OPENROUTESERVICE_API_KEY` environment variable.

```sh
OPENROUTESERVICE_API_KEY=YYY uvx openroute-mcp --stdio
```

In VSCode `mcp.json` file you should have:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "openroute-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "openroute-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "OPENROUTESERVICE_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Click on `Start` just on top of `"openroute-mcp"` to start the connection to the MCP server.
>
> You can click the wrench and screwdriver button üõ†Ô∏è (`Configure Tools...`) to enable/disable specific tools

### üì° Use streamable HTTP server

Connect to a running streamable HTTP MCP server.

In VSCode `mcp.json` you should have the following:

```sh
{
  "servers": {
    "openroute-mcp-http": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8888/mcp",
      "type": "http"
    }
  }
}
```

> [!CAUTION]
>
> The routes created on a public MCP server will be publicly available to anyone.

> More details available in [the VSCode MCP official docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).
